# Development Environment

1. Visual studio 2017 was the development tool used in developing this App. This is one of my favorites because by deafult it has all the tools needed in building a full fleshed application, without getting to start from the scratch 
2. The C# programming language with Dotnet core 5 was used to complete this project. It is has a large community, unique language and serves as a multi purpose language. I used the ASP.NET Core 5 web framework alongside SQL DB 
3. I used GitHub for version control.
